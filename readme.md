# Poubell Chat 
Poubell chat is a chat bot application that run on Line App.
This application will answer your question about how to throw away trash in Japan(somewhere in Saitama Pref).

## Technology 
Poubell Chat uses a number of open source projects to work properly: 

* [Python3] - as a programming language 
* [heroku] - as a cloud application platform
* [Apache Solr] - as a search-engine to search xml data
* [Line SDK for python] - line sdk allows to communicate with users 
* [ngrok] - ngrok secure introspectable tunnels to localhost webhook development tool and debugging tool.  

And of course Poubell Chat itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
